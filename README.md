# Spotify Data Analyzer

The goal of this project is to create an open source method for keeping track of your spotify data. Right now this program just pulls data and stores it in a firestore instance, but I want to make it so the user can swap out storage methods with their preferred method of storage. I also want to add analytics and tracking methods to this project.
